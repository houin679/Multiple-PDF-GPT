Workflow: Chatbot with Document Embedding and User Query Processing
Step 1: Document Upload & Preprocessing
User Uploads Documents:

The user uploads one or more PDF documents via the UI (e.g., using file_uploader in Streamlit).
The uploaded PDFs are then processed to extract the text content from them.
Extract Text from PDFs:

The text is extracted from each page of the PDFs using a library like PyPDF2.
This is done by iterating over each page and collecting the text into a single string.
Text Chunking:

The extracted text is split into smaller, manageable chunks for better processing and faster retrieval.
Text is divided based on a predefined character length (e.g., 1000 characters) using a text splitter.
These chunks represent sections of the document that will be embedded and stored for later retrieval.
Step 2: Embedding Documents
Embedding the Text Chunks:

The chunks of text are passed through an embedding model (like HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings).
This model converts each text chunk into a vector (embedding), which is a numerical representation that captures the meaning of the text.
These document embeddings are stored in a vector store (e.g., FAISS) for efficient similarity search.
Key Concept:

The text is transformed into a high-dimensional vector space where each document chunk's semantic meaning is represented as a vector.
Storing the Embeddings:

The embeddings are saved in the vector store (FAISS), which is optimized for fast similarity search.
The vector store can be queried later to find the most relevant document chunks based on similarity to the user query.
Step 3: User Query Processing
User Asks a Question:

The user enters a question into the UI (e.g., using text_input in Streamlit).
This query is in the form of natural language and needs to be processed for matching with document chunks.
Embedding the User Query:

The user's query is passed through the same pre-trained embedding model (e.g., HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings).
The model converts the query into an embedding (vector), similar to the document chunk embeddings.
The goal is to capture the meaning of the user's question in a way that can be compared with the document embeddings.
Step 4: Query-Document Matching
Similarity Search in Vector Store:

The query embedding is compared with the document embeddings stored in the vector store.
Cosine similarity or another distance metric is used to measure the proximity between the query vector and the document chunk vectors.
The system retrieves the most similar document chunks based on the highest similarity score.
Retrieve Relevant Chunks:

The top N (e.g., 5 or 10) most similar document chunks are retrieved based on their similarity to the user query.
These document chunks are the most relevant content to the user’s question.
Step 5: Response Generation
Processing the Retrieved Chunks:

The retrieved document chunks are then processed. Depending on the implementation, these could be directly returned to the user as a response or passed through a natural language generation model (if needed) for more refined answers.
Returning the Response:

The system generates and displays the answer to the user based on the information from the most relevant document chunks.
The response is shown in the UI, allowing the user to see the results derived from the documents.
Step 6: Continuous Interaction (Optional)
User Refines the Query:

The user may ask follow-up questions or refine their query, restarting the process by entering a new question.
The system continues to process the query using the steps above to provide further answers.
Repeat the Process:

This process repeats as needed with each new user query. The text chunk embeddings and the pre-trained model embeddings are reused across queries, optimizing the system’s performance.
Overall Workflow Visualization:
Document Upload: User uploads PDFs → Text extraction from PDFs.
Text Chunking: Split extracted text into chunks for processing.
Document Embedding: Embed each text chunk using a pre-trained model.
Storing Embeddings: Store the document embeddings in a vector store (e.g., FAISS).
User Query: User inputs a query.
Query Embedding: Embed the user's query using the same pre-trained model.
Search & Retrieval: Perform similarity search between query embedding and document embeddings in the vector store.
Response Generation: Retrieve relevant chunks, generate and display a response.
Repeat: User asks more questions or refines their queries.
Summary of Key Concepts:
Embeddings: Both document chunks and user queries are transformed into vectors (embeddings) using a pre-trained model.
Vector Store: Embeddings are stored in a vector store (FAISS) for efficient similarity search.
Similarity Search: User queries are compared to document embeddings using similarity metrics like cosine similarity.
Natural Language Processing: The system uses pre-trained models for embedding both document text and user queries to facilitate understanding and matching.
